        <h1>Taco Meat</h1>
        <p></p>This recipe makes just the taco meat. You have to buy everything else, of course.
         Make a big batch and use for a multiple of different meals: add to bean burritos for a
          more hearty and tasty burrito, or add a can of beans (kidney, red, or pinto) and use
           for Frito Pie, Navajo tacos, or taco salad.
